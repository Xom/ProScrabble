This project was originally a blitzkrieg project done in 5 days over Winter
break to create a fast AI to find the optimal move on a Scrabble board 
(greedy algorithm). 
    For ACM at Portland State University we are now putting forth a challenge
for all interested parties to create scrabble AIs. Hence I've updated some code
on the acm\_challenge branch that needs to be updated on the main branch.

The first stage will be for competitors to see who can get the best scores on 
various test boards. 

I plan on eventually making some server code so that AIs can play entire games
against each other. 

I also plan on using machine learning to improve this algorithm to take into 
account letters remaining and rack balancing.
