Here is an example Scrabble Move Format (TM) 
    "scrbl_move:" must be on the start of the line. Then the tiles used from
your rack are in parentheses e.g. "(EQRY)". Then you give the row, col your 
play starts on (This is where the main word you formed *starts* not where you 
place your first tile!) Last there is the direction of play, EAST or SOUTH. 

MOVE FORMAT: 
scrbl_move: (tiles_used) (ROW, COL, word_played, EAST |SOUTH)

EXAMPLE 1: 
scrbl_move: (EQRY) (4, 4, EQUERRY, EAST)

EXAMPLE 2: 
scrbl_move: (AES) (1, 4, AXES, SOUTH)

EXAMPLE 3: 
scrbl_move: (BAST) (7, 7, BASTION, EAST)
