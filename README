ACM Challenge: 

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create the awesomest, 
fastest, most badass Scrabble AI. 
    Your first task is to create a program that takes a scrabble test file from
standard in and then outputs a scrabble move to standard out. 

You can find example test files from the testcases/ subfolder. 
    Your output should look like this:

scrbl_move: (tiles_used) (ROW, COL, word_played, EAST | SOUTH)

See examples/ for more examples.
